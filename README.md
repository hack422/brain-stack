### Getting Started üöÄ

#### Prerequisites
- Node.js >= 18
- MongoDB database (Atlas or self‚Äëhosted)
- Cloudinary account
- Gmail (or SMTP) account for transactional email

#### 1) Clone and install
```bash
git clone <your-fork-or-repo-url>
cd brainstack
npm install
```

#### 2) Configure environment
Create a `.env.local` in the project root:
```bash
# Database
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://<user>:<pass>@<cluster>/<db>?retryWrites=true&w=majority

# Cloudinary
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret

# Email (Gmail example)
EMAIL_USER=your.email@example.com

# Google OAuth
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=xxxxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.apps.googleusercontent.com

GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000/api/auth/google/callback
```

#### 3) Run the app

### Usage üìñ

- **Browse content**: Go to `/materials` and choose your semester and subject. Switch between tabs: Notes, PYQs, Formulas, Timetable, Assignments, Events, E‚ÄëBooks, and Video Lectures.
- **Authentication**: Use Google sign‚Äëin. You‚Äôll receive an email OTP for verification. Admins are recognized via the allow‚Äëlist in `lib/googleAuth.ts`.
- **Admin content management**: Admins access the panel at `/admin` to upload notes, e‚Äëbooks, or add YouTube videos. Files are stored on Cloudinary, and metadata is saved to MongoDB.

Core content shape stored in MongoDB:
```ts
type Content = {
  branch: string
  semester: string
  subject: string
  contentType: 'notes' | 'pyq' | 'formulas' | 'timetable' | 'assignments' | 'events' | 'video' | 'ebook'
  fileName?: string
  fileUrl?: string
  publicId?: string
  fileSize?: number
  mimeType?: string
  videoTitle?: string
  videoUrl?: string
  videoId?: string
  uploadedBy: string
  uploadDate: Date
}
```
